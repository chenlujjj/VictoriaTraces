## http2server

`http2server` package is ported from [`github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/lib/httpserver`](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/lib/httpserver),
with HTTP/2 support enabled. Only core features are preserved.

It would work as an experimental package for HTTP/2 support before it is included in the source.
